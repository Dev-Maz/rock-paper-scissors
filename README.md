In this project I made a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game in the browser's console using JavaScript.

I used some basic JavaScript (and programming in general) concepts like loops, conditionals and object methods. The project was pretty straightforward and I didn't get stuck in any of the steps and completely enjoyed the process.

It doesn't have a user interface yet, but according to TOP I'll add the UI later in the curriculum.

EDIT: I came back to this project and added a simple UI. Now the player can play the game using the buttons.

I used some DOM manipulation methods to make this UI, alongside the HTML and CSS knowledge that I gained throughout the curriculum.

Again, the process was very enjoyable and the challenges that I faced were fun to solve.
