In this project I made a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game in the browser's console using JavaScript.

I used some basic JavaScript (and programming in general) concepts like loops, conditionals and object methods. The project was pretty straightforward and I didn't get stuck in any of the steps and completely enjoyed the process.

It doesn't have a user interface yet, but according to TOP I'll add the UI later in the curriculum.
